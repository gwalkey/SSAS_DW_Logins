<h2>Deploy the Tabular Model</h2> 

Open the VS2017 SSAS Tabular solution and deploy the model to your SSAS instance (default is localhost)

If your SSAS instance is NOT on the same server as the Central Server SQL engine hosting the Relational Databases,<br>
you need to change the Data Source of the Tabular Model before you deploy it
