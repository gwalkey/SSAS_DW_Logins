<h2>Quick Deploy</h2>

* You can accelerate the system setup by restoring the SQL and SSAS Tabular Databases instead of building them from scratch<br>
* Once restored, you should delete the sample SQL data in '''ServerTrace_DW''' and re-process the Tabular Model
* All SQL Agent Jobs, Posh Scripts and Tabular Model conncetions point to '''localhost'''
* The default installation was for both SQL and SSAS Tabular installed on the same box

<h3>OLTP Database</h3>
Restore the [inbound.bak]

<h3>OLAP Database</h3>
Restore the [ServerTrace_DW.bak]

<h3>SSAS Tabular Database</h3>
Restore the [ServerTrace.abf] to an SSAS Tabular instance

<h2>Tabular Model to SQL Connections</h2>

* Create a SQL Login and User that will be used by the Tabular Model to connect to ServerTrace_DW (or run the Model as Impersonate SQL service)
* You must get the Tabular Model to talk to the SQL database (ServerTrace_DW) before the SQL Agent jobs automatically ETL and prep the SSAS Model

<h2>Design Details</h2>

* The ETL does a typical automatic probe and load of new Dimensions members(Type 1 only)
* There is no usage of SSIS to load Dimension and Fact tables ...because SQL can do that with the MERGE statment
* There is nothing keeping you from using Azure Analysis Services (except for the higher cost and data transfer times)<br>

<h2> Operational Statistics</h2>
Since this is a one-measure Fact Table, the entire 5 year database I run is still pretty small:

* 35 Million Fact Table Rows
* 25 Billion Logins
* SQL OLAP Database with Clustered Columnstore Index  - 4GB
* SSAS MD Cube - 300MB
* SSAS Tabular Model - 520MB
* Yes, MD is smaller using MOLAP Storage than xVelocity 
* Tabular sometimes is faster opening and collapsing the Pivot Table drill-down Levels

<h2> Optional Enhancements</h2>

* Power BI Outlier Detection: logging in outside norms (name/hour) or(name/host)
* Email Notification of newly arriving Dimension members
* Threshold Alerting (Â± 2.5 Std Dev) of prior days connections (system hung or dead)
